## Pipeline Modules

### pose_extractor.py
- `extract_poses(video_path, verbose=True)` → `(list[FramePose], video_meta)`
- Subsamples to 15 fps max, downscales to 640px width (OOM prevention)
- model_complexity=1 (was 2, downgraded for memory)

### metrics_calculator.py
- `calculate_metrics(frame_poses, fps)` → `list[FrameMetrics]`
- Steps: raw calc → gap-fill → velocities → smooth (3-frame window) → re-calc velocities
- **Y-axis is inverted**: smaller Y = higher in frame

### phase_detector.py
- `detect_phases(metrics, fps)` → `PhaseResult`
- 7 phases: SETUP → BACKLIFT_STARTS → HANDS_PEAK → FRONT_FOOT_DOWN → CONTACT → FOLLOW_THROUGH → UNKNOWN
- Detects via wrist velocity sign reversals + threshold crossings
- Seeds from first 15 detected frames; constrains peak search to first 45% of stroke

### coaching_rules.py
- `run_all_rules(metrics, phases, baseline)` → `dict[pillar: list[Fault]]`
- **Current stage: R4-partial + R3 complete (2026-04-29).**
- Active rules: A1, A3, A5, T2, S2, S4, F1, F3, F4, F5, F6 (11 active)
- Suspended rules: A2, A4, T1, S1, S3, F2 (6 suspended; F2 is suspended, not deleted)
- Deleted rules: A6, T3, T4, T5
- Pillar weights: Option B3 — Access/Tracking/Stability/Flow remain 25 each, with each pillar normalised by active rule capacity

### scorer.py
- `build_scores(fault_map, phases, baseline, video_meta)` → `BattingIQResult`
- Pillar score = 25 − normalised active-rule deduction share
- Traffic lights: Green ≥20, Amber 12–19, Red <12
- BattingIQ = sum of 4 pillars (0–100)
- Bands: Excellent 85–100, Good 70–84, Developing 55–69, Work Needed 40–54, Fundamentals <40
- Priority fix: highest deduction in lowest pillar (tiebreak: stability > tracking > access > flow)

### models.py — Key Types
- `RawLandmark`: x, y, z, visibility
- `FramePose`: frame_idx, timestamp, landmarks (None if undetected)
- `FrameMetrics`: 30+ fields per frame
- `PhaseResult`: labels[], setup_end, backlift_start, hands_peak, front_foot_down, contact, follow_through_start, timing diffs
- `Fault`: rule_id, fault, deduction, detail, feedback
- `PillarScore`: score, max, status, faults[], positives[]
- `BattingIQResult`: all of the above assembled

### config.py
- Single source of truth for ALL thresholds
- FRONT_SIDE = "left" (right-handed batter from bowler's end)
- Phase detection: wrist rise threshold, consecutive frame counts, velocity window sizes
- Metric smoothing: 3-frame window
- Scoring: pillar max (25), traffic light thresholds (20/12), score bands

---

## Reference Baseline

- Location: `reference/reference_baseline.json`
- Built by: `python reference_builder.py test_batting.mov`
- All 21 coaching rules scale thresholds relative to this baseline
- **Risk:** If missing, `run_analysis.py` rebuilds from input video (circular — not ideal)

---

## Known Fragile Areas

1. **Phase detection** — relies on wrist velocity sign reversals; noisy video/lighting can confuse it. Mitigated by 3–5 frame smoothing.
2. **Gap filling** — forward-fills missing detections with last-known value. Long gaps (>10 frames) can propagate stale data.
3. **Y-axis inversion** — MediaPipe Y: smaller = higher. Phase/metric code must account for this everywhere.
4. **Frame index vs subsampled index** — video annotator uses original frame count; phases detected on 15fps subsampled frames. Off-by-one risk if indexing mixes these.
5. **Reference baseline dependency** — all rules silently degrade if baseline is wrong/missing.
6. **Coaching rules fail silently** — each rule wrapped in try-catch; failure logs a warning but skips that fault.
7. **No auth** — API is fully public. Results are accessible by anyone who knows the job_id.

---

## Conventions to Follow

- **Module naming:** `lowercase_with_underscores.py`
- **Classes/dataclasses:** PascalCase
- **Functions:** `lowercase_with_underscores()`
- **Private helpers:** `_leading_underscore()`
- **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE`
- **Type hints** on all function signatures
- **f-strings** for string formatting
- **Docstrings** on public functions only
- **config.py** is the only place to add new thresholds — never hardcode in rule/metric files
- **models.py** is the only place to add new data structures

---

## Deployment

- `start.py` reads `PORT` env var (default 8000), runs `uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0`
- `railway.json`: Dockerfile builder, `python start.py` start command, `/health` check (300s timeout), ON_FAILURE restart (max 3)
- Dockerfile validates imports at build time: `python -c "from api import app"`
- No database — stateless, file-based job outputs in `results/{job_id}/`
- No authentication

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Handedness: runtime parameter, not X-mirroring.** We considered mirroring X coordinates for LHB to convert them to RHB-equivalent space. Rejected because MediaPipe landmarks are anatomical (LEFT_SHOULDER is always the person's left, regardless of batting side). Instead, the side mapping (which landmarks are "front" vs "back") is made a runtime parameter passed through the pipeline.

2. **Video codec: H.264 over mp4v.** The current `mp4v` codec (MPEG-4 Part 2) produces visibly poor quality. We switch to H.264 via ffmpeg subprocess for reliable encoding with quality control.

3. **Frame index alignment: lookup table.** The annotator will build a mapping from original frame indices to subsampled metric indices, rather than assuming 1:1 correspondence.

---

## Implementation Plan (2026-03-21)

### Phase 2 — Handedness Support

**Root cause:** `FRONT_SIDE = "left"` is a module-level constant in `config.py:19`. It's consumed at import time by `metrics_calculator.py:48-73` to create module-level side-mapping constants (`FRONT_SHOULDER = LEFT_SHOULDER`, etc.). These are frozen when the server starts. Every request uses the same mapping. Left-handed batters get analyzed with wrong front/back joints.

**Directional audit of all 21 rules:**
- 20 rules are direction-safe (use `abs()`, variance, or Y-axis only)
- **S3 (hip drift)** has a hard-coded directional X comparison (`hip_x < front_ankle_x`) that assumes RHB screen orientation — broken for LHB

**Files to change:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `config.py` | Keep `FRONT_SIDE` as default; add `DEFAULT_HANDEDNESS = "right"` |
| `metrics_calculator.py` | Replace module-level side mapping with `_build_side_map(front_side)` function; add `front_side` param to `calculate_metrics()` and `_calc_frame()` |
| `coaching_rules.py` | Fix S3: pass `front_side` and flip direction check for LHB |
| `run_analysis.py` | Accept `handedness` param, derive `front_side`, thread through pipeline |
| `api.py` | Add `handedness` form param (values: "right", "left"; default: "right") |
| `models.py` | Add `handedness` and `handedness_source` to `BattingIQResult` |
| `report_generator.py` | Include `handedness` in JSON report |

**Handedness → front_side mapping:**
- `handedness="right"` → `front_side="left"` (person's left side is front)
- `handedness="left"` → `front_side="right"` (person's right side is front)

**Verification:**
- Unit test: calculate_metrics with front_side="left" vs "right" on same landmarks produces swapped front/back values
- Unit test: S3 correctly detects drift for both RHB and LHB
- Integration: report includes `handedness` and `handedness_source` fields
- Regression: RHB scoring unchanged (front_side="left" is current behavior)

**Risks:**
- Reference baseline was built with RHB. LHB analysis still compares against RHB baseline. This is acceptable for Phase 2 (the rules compare joint angles/positions, which are canonical front/back regardless of handedness). But directional baseline values (head_offset_mean sign, hip_centre_x_mean) need care — all current uses are `abs()` so this is safe.

### Phase 3 — HD Video Quality

**Root causes identified:**

1. **Codec (`video_annotator.py:107`):** `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v")` — MPEG-4 Part 2 produces blurry output.
2. **Frame index mismatch (`video_annotator.py:122-123`):** Annotator counts every original frame but indexes into subsampled metrics/labels array as if 1:1. At 30fps input with frame_step=2, metrics[1] is for original frame 2, but annotator shows it at original frame 1. Second half of video shows no metrics at all.
3. **Storyboard resolution (`video_annotator.py:216`):** `_THUMB_W = 320` — thumbnails are small.
4. **No bitrate control:** cv2.VideoWriter offers no quality settings for mp4v.

**Files to change:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `video_annotator.py` | (1) Write raw frames with overlays to temp file, then re-encode with ffmpeg to H.264 with CRF quality. (2) Build frame_idx→metric lookup from `metrics[i].frame_idx`. (3) Increase `_THUMB_W` to 480. |
| `pose_extractor.py` | Store `frame_step` in `video_meta` so annotator knows the subsampling rate |

**Approach:**
- Render annotated frames to a temporary AVI (lossless or near-lossless with MJPG/raw)
- Re-encode with `ffmpeg -crf 23 -preset medium -c:v libx264` to produce clean H.264 MP4
- Fall back to current mp4v approach if ffmpeg is unavailable
- Build a dict `{original_frame_idx: metric_list_index}` from `FrameMetrics.frame_idx` fields
- For frames between subsampled frames, use nearest prior metric (same as gap-fill logic)

**Verification:**
- Visual comparison: output video should be sharp at original resolution
- File size: H.264 CRF 23 should produce smaller files than mp4v at better quality
- Frame alignment: metrics overlay should match the correct batting phase for each frame
- Storyboard: visually larger and clearer panels

**Risks:**
- ffmpeg must be available in the container (already in Dockerfile: `ffmpeg` is installed)
- Temporary file disk usage during encoding (mitigated: cleanup after encode)

### Phase 4 — Fragile Areas Backlog (Ranked)

**4A. Phase detection fragility**
- Add diagnostic logging: log velocity values, sign reversals, and threshold crossings
- Add phase detection confidence/quality metrics to report
- Consider: fall back to position-based detection when velocity is ambiguous

**4B. Frame index mismatch** (addressed in Phase 3)

**4C. Reference baseline dependency**
- Make `run_analysis.py` raise a clear warning (not silently rebuild from input)
- Add `baseline_status` field to report: "reference" | "self_calibrated" | "missing"
- Log which baseline was used and its source video

**4D. Gap filling**
- Add max gap threshold (e.g., 10 frames). Beyond that, mark metrics as `low_confidence`
- Add `gap_filled` boolean field to FrameMetrics
- Include detection quality summary in report

**4E. Silent rule failures**
- Replace bare `print()` warning with structured logging
- Add `rules_evaluated` and `rules_failed` counts to report
- Return which rules failed and why

**4F. Public results access**
- Add UUID-based expiry (auto-delete results after 1 hour)
- Consider signed URLs or token-based access
- Document the exposure in API docs

**Delivery order:** 4A → 4C → 4D → 4E → 4F (4B is covered by Phase 3)

---

## Current State

- Codebase fully explored on 2026-03-20
- Implementation plan written on 2026-03-21
- **Phase 2 complete**: Handedness support for left-handed batters. API accepts `handedness` param. 7 tests.
- **Phase 3 complete**: HD video output via H.264/ffmpeg. Frame index alignment fixed. Storyboard 480px. 5 tests.
- **Phase 4 partially complete**: Phase diagnostics (4A), baseline validation (4C), gap filling limits (4D), rule health reporting (4E) — all done. Remaining: 4F (auth/access control) — documented only, not implemented.
- 12 automated tests in `tests/`
- OOM crashes previously fixed: model_complexity 2→1, frame downscaling, skip-frame processing, no MediaPipe re-run in annotator

### Remaining Work
- **4F: Public results access** — no auth. Anyone with a job_id can download results. Recommend: UUID-based expiry + signed URLs.
- **Calibration/held-out split:** 4 videos locked as held-out (Drive_Average.MOV, Drive_Beginner 2.MOV, Viv P_Offdrive Elite.mov, AlexT_Ondrive Good.MOV). All R-track and F-track deliverables must report tuning MAE and held-out MAE side by side. See `heldout_discipline.md`.
- **Auto-detection of handedness** — deferred. Explicit API param is sufficient for now. Auto-detection is fragile due to camera angle dependency.
- **LHB reference baseline** — all rules compare against RHB baseline. LHB analysis uses canonical front/back which makes angle comparisons valid, but a dedicated LHB baseline would improve accuracy.
- **Integration tests** — end-to-end pipeline tests with actual video require MediaPipe + OpenCV in CI.
